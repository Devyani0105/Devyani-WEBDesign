  <h1>Types of Web Development for Beginners</h1>
  <p>Web developer is one of the most interesting career paths for a computer science major because it combines analytical and technical skills with creative design and development. Web developers work with professionals in IT, sales and marketing,
    and other departments to build websites that attract and keep customers, contributing to a business’s sales growth or a government agency’s effectiveness. Websites are so crucial to a company’s success that the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics
    (BLS) projects the demand for web developers to grow 8% between 2019 and 2029.</p>

  <p>There are three types of web development roles: developers who specialize in the user interface (“front-end”), those who write the underlying code for running all website operations (“back-end”), and those who manage all aspects of a website
    (“full stack”). Each type focuses on a different area of web development, but they all have one thing in common: coding. A bachelor’s in computer science is a great way to learn the programming skills required for a web development career.</p>
